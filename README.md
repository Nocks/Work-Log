# Work-Log
Treehouse Python Techdegree - Project 3

A terminal application for logging what work someone did on a certain day. The user can either add new entries or look up previous ones.

To add an entry, the user would have to enter the name of the task, duration, date, and any general notes about the task. The entry is then saved in a CSV.

Previous entries can be looked up either by a particular date (or date range) or by a string (either as a regular expression or a plain text). Search results are printed to the screen, including the name of task, date, time spent, and general notes.
